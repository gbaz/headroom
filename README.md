So you are tired of managing license headers in your codebase by hand? Then __Headroom__ is the right tool for you! Now you can define your license header as [Mustache][web:mustache] template, put all the placeholders (such as author's name, year, etc.) into the [YAML][wiki:yaml] config file and Headroom will take care to add such license headers to all your source code files.

## Main Features
- __License Header Management__ - allows to add, replace or drop license headers in source code files.
- __License Header Autodetection__ - you can even replace or drop license headers that weren't generated by Headroom, as they are automatically detected from source code files, not from template files.
- __Open Source License Generator__ - generates license header templates for most common _open source_ licenses. You can use these as-is, customize them or ignore them and use your custom templates.

## Installation
> Binary distribution, pre-built packages and installation from Stackage is not ready yet, but it's planned for production release.

### From Source Code
Headroom is written in [Haskell][web:haskell], so you can just clone this repository and install it using [Stack][web:stack]:

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh     # needed only if you don't have Stack
git clone https://github.com/vaclavsvejcar/headroom.git
cd headroom/
stack install
```

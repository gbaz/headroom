So you are tired of managing license headers in your codebase by hand? Then _Headroom_ is the right tool for you! Now you can define your license header as [Mustache][web:mustache] template, put all the placeholders (such as author's name, year, etc.) into the [YAML][wiki:yaml] config file and Headroom will take care to add such license headers to all your source code files.

[wiki:yaml]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML
